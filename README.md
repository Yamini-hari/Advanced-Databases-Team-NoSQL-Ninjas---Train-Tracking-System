# Train-Tracking-System-Advanced-Databases-

This project aims to develop a comprehensive train tracking system with multiple functionalities including real-time train tracking, dynamic fare calculation, optimal path finding, statistics dashboard, and real-time seat reservation.

1. Real-time Train Tracking: Utilizing Redis for fast data retrieval and MongoDB for data storage and redundancy, this feature displays nearby trains on a map using Leaflet.js, enabling users to monitor train movements.
2. Dynamic Fare Calculation: Calculates fares dynamically based on various factors such as distance, class, and time of booking, providing accurate fare estimates to users.
3. Optimal Path Finding: Allows users to find the optimal route between two stations, considering factors like travel time, number of transfers, and train availability.
4. Statistics Dashboard: Provides insightful statistics and visualizations on train operations, passenger traffic, and other relevant metrics, aiding in decision-making and performance analysis.
5. Real-time Seat Reservation: Enables users to reserve seats on trains in real-time, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free booking experience.
This project aims to enhance user experience, improve operational efficiency, and provide valuable insights into train operations.
